version 1.0.2 (Alpha)

----- It is a micro framework written in Vanilla Javascript (Written Style : ECMAScript2015). Have bunch of cool stuffs likes :
1. Bind event on window load or/and document state change. It's a nice concept globally acceptable, use for realtime application and SPA. Likely similar to jQuery 'on' event listner functionality. I call it as 'event listner' or 'dynamic'.

2. Generate css in less codeing. I call it 'variable CSS' or 'vCSS'.

3. Customise element action. I call it as 'element JS' or '_el'.

4. Hash Routing capability. I call it as 'route JS' or 'State'.
 
5. Hook functionality. I call it as 'hook JS' or 'HOOK'.

6. Modularity in functionality. I call it as 'module JS' or 'Module'.

7. Templating in UI. I call it as 'block JS' or 'Block'.

8. Model Class for data. I call it as 'data JS' or 'Data'.

9. Data Validation Class. I call it as 'input validate JS' or 'Validation'.

10. Has user defined help function and custmize JS prototype for predefined objects. I call it as 'Helper' and 'Prototype' respectively.
